 Was mental state co-pilot
 Airlines confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of crashing last week in the French Alps
 Lubitz told Lufthansa flight training that he had a "previous episode of depression," the airline said
 Correspondence between Lufthansa said in resuming his flight
 indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's depression put him in the cockpit
 Luftthansa CEO Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a "swift and seamless clarification" and said it was sharing the documents -- including medical records -- with prosecutors
Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains across a steep mountainside
 The crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village,, where grieving families have left flowers. 
No human remains were at the site recovery teams. 
French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said it should be possible to identify the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, authorities suggested
 The recovery of the victims' belongings will start Wednesday, said
 Personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the passengers and crew on board

 Lufthansa Lufthansa told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, passed all his examinations and "held all the licenses"

 There's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal before. 
 Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his condition would cause him to lose his license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN
 "big part of his life," the source said, it's one theory being considered
 Source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he would be allowed to fly because of his medical problems
 Lubitz told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work, the official said
 About mental health, there's more to the story,. 
 "Psychology can explain why somebody would turn on themselves about the fact that they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they," he said
 "there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to rage and turn it outward on people who had nothing to do with the problems

Minnesota Gov
 Pawlenty, who called on the GOP to "be the party of Sam's Club," told CNN that Walmart's actions "foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move."
 "The Republican Party will have" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for finance
 Party leaders must be "willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as gays and lesbians
Walmart, which employs 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday
Hours after the company, Doug McMillon, called on Gov
 Hutchinson veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation.

 Obama's historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with Iran that if the deal collapses, he may fear his legacy

 Last month Wu Rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on International Women's Day China
 The Chinese authorities have detained her and four other activists for "creating disturbances
 They also detained some of the activists' supporters, raided a nongovernmental organization that called for their release, and have at points denied access to medical treatment, lawyers and adequate rest
 The fate of the five will be revealed by April 13 as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or "detained," which in China's legal system
 The timing of the detentions of China's activists is ironic: Not only did they take place on the day that marks women's achievements, but they also come in a year in which Beijing. 
 Appears poised to adopt its first anti-domestic violence law, which is expected to get before the National People's Congress Standing Committee this summer
 This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the World Conference on Women hosted in which Hillary Clinton declared that "women are human rights."
 I met Wu at a conference several years ago at a time when there were very few women in China's. 
 It was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as "babes" or "little sisters," even in professional—and ostensibly. 
 Activists, Wu and others fight on two fronts: against overt rights violations by the Chinese government and women to second-class citizens
 By the time we met two years later, Wu and her colleagues were clearly off
 They staged small, public "art" protests that attracted media headlines, energized the more mainstream and academically inclined movement, and pushed women's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government. 
 Typical of her times
 She comes from the countryside, which for many has. 
 The economy has soared, but her generation is confronting the consequences of unchecked growth: pollution, food and inequality between rich and poor
 Like many parents, she worries about how to find milk powder for her infant boy and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the. 
 clear-eyed about the problems of China's development model, and want to address those
~~
 It is in Yirenping that she became attuned to the challenges in China
 Wu and her colleagues have a shock factor "occupying" public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women, donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence, shaving their heads to protest higher education for women. 
 Is what the government epitomize. 
 They are young, confident, ready to challenge established norms,, they feel responsible for society and they want to improve it
 As China prepares to mark the anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women in September, it will be harder. 
 Even if they are released, their work promoting women's rights will have become. 
 The women will now be labeled "" at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about groups, their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments (known as "color revolutions"), foreign funding of civil society organizations
 Wu and her colleagues are government effort to. 
Authorities have harassed and detained an expanding list of activists, and imprisoned others, but they have tried to co-opt some by allowing them to provide services the government finds. 
 Kind of "differentiated management" of nongovernmental organizations — punishing some but co-opting others — may work to groups
Those ordinary people that make Wu and her friends' campaigns popular are unlikely to be answered ""
 The Chinese Communist Party faces a dizzying array of challenges, not least that younger generations do not identify with the party. 
 Rather than its list of challenges, the party could resolve concerns about its legitimacy by activists like Wu and her colleagues, rather than criminals

 It's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the video that shows a police officer, Michael Slager, gunning down and killing Walter Scott after a traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina
 The resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation -- along with -- is a welcome response
 The event raises troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of recording
 More than 20 years ago, Congress approved a law, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act,.
 We with patchy information about race and policing play out in America
 What happened today doesn
 No video
 There was no witness to come forward

 "As you can see, the reports stated something totally different." 
Adding it mildly
 Early police statements -- the video came to light -- Slager said that Scott attacked him, that he fired after a scuffle and that medical efforts to revive Scott
 The video makes claims contributed to Slager's murder charges
 "" said North Charleston Mayor
 That leaves Slager to face murder charges that could land him on death row a disturbing reality
 I'm all for body cameras, although they are not a magic cure. 
 Just don't know when and where police killings take place, or whether they. 
 That means we don't know for certain whether or excessive force correlates with officers.
 We don't even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or mental illness

 According to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, "The Attorney General shall, through appropriate means, acquire data about law enforcement officers

 There are multiple reasons. 
 The nation's thousands of -- is a tough,. 
 The job is even harder because police departments, reluctant to air their dirty laundry, fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it's up to the courts to decide whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that's often established after years of court proceedings
 The Congress has failed to press the Justice Department to demand the data. 
 The Death in Custody Act was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014,.

 That common-sense observation is being echoed by the Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing in response to protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including Michael Brown and Eric Garner

 While historical precedent suggests the President move forward without Congress, the Obama administration should learn another lesson from history: Getting Congress' might effort
 The fight for congressional approval would a huge amount
 A move forward with executive-based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of Congress

 There is a argument that will play out over definitional issues, with the potential for court challenges
 There are also significant political questions, a different beast
 For a start, there is growing pressure on Capitol Hill -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give Congress the right. 
 On Tuesday, a deal was reached on legislation proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker that would require President Barack Obama to submit the final deal to Congress,.

 Good reason for Obama. 
 After all, on Capitol Hill, where legislators struggle to pass a routine budget, the notion that they would move on a treaty seems dubious
 There is also a history of Congress. 
 In the 1970s, for example, President Jimmy Carter tried to obtain consent for the SALT II treaties, but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that.
For treaties to no avail
 Iranians took hostages and the Soviets invaded, the treaties died in the Senate
 Even in a contentious congressional environment, presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them political capital and even once the White House exited the struggle bruised and battered.
 Republicans say Iran compromise reached This was the case with another treaty that Carter asked the Senate to ratify: the Panama Treaties

 The signature of Congress is worth a lot in American politics the ratification process brings legitimacy to a agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future president

 A jury of Rolling Stone's media peers has dissected the magazine's story about rape on the campus of the University of Virginia, and the emerging consensus is that Rolling Stone's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice by the magazine's head-in-the-sand response report

Anonymous, given the name "Jackie," told Rolling Stone Erdely she had been invited to a party -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys, who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student, who invited Jackie to the party
 The allegations sparked protests against the fraternity, a police investigation, the suspension of fraternities at the school debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses
 The story began to unravel when Washington Post reporter T. Rees Shapiro took a closer look, leading Rolling Stone to back from the story and request a review by Columbia University Graduate School
 That review, which is longer than the article, reveals lapses in basic journalistic practice
 Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and never confronted him with the allegations; she spoke to three of Jackie's friends immediately after the attack, and she gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond,.
 At every step of the way, Jackie began refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story -- neither Erdely nor her editors or the magazine's fact checkers made the decision to hit the pause button and decline to the story

 (CNN)If someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users, would that?
 Would be no
 For decades, many have stood by the belief that such programs, syringe exchange or syringe programs, promote and encourage drug use
For Congress, it became the rationale behind a ban that prohibits the use of federal funds for programs
 Of scientific evidence that this is true
 As a result of the recent hepatitis C infections among injecting drug users in rural Indiana and Kentucky, the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore
 And this time, scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread. 
://www.
 Between 2006 and 2012, at least 30 states experienced at least a 200% increase in acute infections. 
 The prevalence of hepatitis C among people under 30 rose from 36% to 49% in years
 With such numbers in mind, the spotlight on syringe programs offers a critical opportunity for us to. 
 Dozens of studies have demonstrated how effective syringe programs have been in the fight against HIV and hepatitis C transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of syringes. 
 Strengthen syringes, these programs promote public health and safety by taking syringes off the streets from injuries
 They also offer preventive health services, such as HIV testing and counseling, and form vital bridges to drug treatment,.
 States such as New York have played a crucial role in HIV transmission among injecting drug users
 The first state in the United States to exchange opened a syringe in 1988
 In New York City where half of all drug users were HIV positive in the 1980s -- state legislators AIDS.
 The expansion of programs in New York was followed by a dramatic reduction in HIV incidence among injecting drug users, declining from 54% in 1990 to 13% during this period

 Congress needs to start out hearings to find out in detail what current programs are. 
 This will mean asking the Departments of State and Defense to lay out a detailed budget to show what capabilities those capabilities will be. 
 At the same time, Congress needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that can do their job

 The White House will celebrate Earth Day and its work to fend off climate change, while ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists
 Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy it
 is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power plan
 From reality
EPA's "Proposed Clean Power Plan".

 In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry. 
 They determine how emission targets are set and what states.

 Under this scenario, EPA's model actually increase
 Obama's EPA policy shift in a
EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill, the agency indicated nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill
 The Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet targets in the legislation
 This policy shift come
 At a hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's so-called Clean Power Plan and that plan adopts the same policy -- carbon-free
 EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices energy
 Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so they. 
 The modeling that assumes the nuclear energy the renewables. 
 A favorable assumption although solar panels are believed to last 30 years.
 Anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order ", which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions
 Although existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it. 
 I have fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security,.

 Civil contempt
 Often so, papa is a rolling stone and he falls behind on his payments
 A parent has fallen behind, the court clerk sends dad an order to show up show.
 At the hearing, that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that, well, he would love to pay, but right now he's in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established. 
's too poor to pay his child
 The court may hold him in civil contempt and imprison him until he purges.
 Typically a telethon show prison

 The result would have been the same: If he had a warrant, he was going "
 Of course, the counterargument is: If we arrest them, how else do we make dads pay
 Hard answer
 The better question may be: Why do we as a society shun parents who don
 Stronger threat of arrest
 Extreme solution that could be solved more involvement
The Scott situation has harsh truths
 If we continue to arrest deadbeat dads, we can be surprised when an officer uses deadly force to arrest them
 We're training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest.
 Are we comfortable using an armed police force, empowered to use deadly force bills
 If we are, then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to get stopped for a broken taillight
 And if we're comfortable with that, then we have to be comfortable with the police giving chase,.

 fatalities following the magnitude-7.8 quake Saturday are difficult to confirm -- considering that communication lines have been disrupted -- estimates we are hearing from the ground are already placing the number lost in the thousands, with the official toll now at around 1,500 expected to keep growing as the hours pass

 Getting food to people will be a logistical nightmare, given that the country -- which is about the size of Tennessee -- is served by two main roads, which have been badly damaged, if not destroyed
 We have been in situations like this know what

 With that in mind, we have set up a fund to address the immediate needs of children,.

 Nepalese will remember the last major earthquake, the psychological toll for the majority of the country will be a significant and ongoing for us as we and other agencies launch our response

 Indonesia's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or, more accurately, the state at any moment
 German sociologist pointed out, one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the use of violence

 Indonesian President Joko Widodo invested hopes -- he can make a couple of his defense
 Popularly known as Jokowi, is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many Indonesians see as a problem
Indonesia's domestic political context and to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room
 This is not a justification for his actions, but it explains why he was so impervious to pleas
 Think about the administration of justice in Indonesia Jokowi can claim. 
 We may not like Indonesia's laws, but they are being applied even-handedly within national borders. 
 Significantly, it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of Indonesia's leaders ability -- or even desire, perhaps -- to violence
 Countries -- including Australia -- kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course
 State-sanctioned violence seems germane when we consider another president about whom great things. 
 Barack Obama was predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would make the of his predecessor
ingly, while Obama has been criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit to the Middle East, this has done nothing to curb the use of state-sanctioned violence
 The use of drone strikes has become a war on terror

 Schaeffer said the chief justice could have remained silent on an issue before the court

 The Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that same-sex marriage

 Hermann sought a neutral background
 He first tried shooting under a bridge near the market, but realized the lighting did not match the mood he wanted to create
 decided to create the portraits by the
ingly smog and studio lights of his own to produce a surreal look that made his subjects stand out

 The warning to hear
 The leader refuses to look at the challenges of the 21st century: radical Islam
 The Obama White House's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical Islam in the Asia
 Not to mention here in Canada
 The Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater while leaving a?
 The Syrian jihad gave rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which now uses Syria as a rear operating base to its jihad in Jordan
 Libya is being used as a rear operating base by ISIS to redraw the map of the Middle.
 The pace America's commander-in-chief is allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both ISIS and its progenitor, al Qaeda, the picture of what's in store is clear: The count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate. 
 Neither the United States nor our. 
 Academics say something new to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of ISIS and al Qaeda as distinct
 The fact is they are the foremost threats to the global security, are manifestations
 Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world as it is,.
 There is no shortage of sound foresight on the parts of the world's. 
 The National Strategy published by the White House
 asserted that, "Since the beginning of 2011, the transformative change sweeping North Africa and the Middle East -- along with the death of Osama bin Laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat."
 Fast forward to America's top intelligence official, director of National Intelligence James Clapper, advised Congress that al Qaeda was no less capable of threatening the United States.
 Al Qaeda was on the run, as President Obama described the terrorist enterprise, a report by terrorism expert Seth Jones of the RAND Corporation highlighted another inconvenient truth for the White House: As restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like Libya, Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring. :
 The number of Salafi jihadist groups increased by 58%. 
 are fueled by Salafiyya Jihadiyya, an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al Qaeda, but is the source code for ISIS
 From the National Security Strategy produced by the Obama White House in February is any meaningful discussion concerning threats posed
 Osama bin Laden president
vernment, bin Laden's death has lifted the shadow over America's security
 Within days of our new National Security Strategy's publication date, in the seventh issue of ISIS's magazine Dabiq, the group's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin Laden,.
 Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the al Qaeda branch that claimed credit for the attack in Paris at Charlie Hebdo -- has also become a failed state
 AQAP is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al Qaeda and the Obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of Qaeda's global network
 The months before the Yemeni government was overthrown by rebels, President Obama described the U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al Qaeda --
 The president appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the Middle East
 They thinking
 How do they plan now
 Despite what the White House wants the world to believe, a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities: ISIS controls a large amount of territory in the Middle East,, while at the same time inspiring attacks in the West
 ISIS is trying to "out al Qaeda" al Qaeda, resorting to stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world, al Qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the United. 
 At the same time, the routine failures of President Obama and his advisers to understand the security environment,.
 Americans, our allies. 
Indeed, President Obama's refusal to call a problem like radical Islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating.
 Has shown the dangers our leaders don't face a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our weight behind efforts
 The resources at his disposal
 For the Middle East and North Africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions, he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the the White House
 There is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of Pollyannaish theories about how to attain this. 
 Attention to what Arab states say
 Most of their bosses would love to be the of defeating ISIS
 All of them recognize that, unless we want things to get a lot worse before they might get any better, the United States will have to deploy our "kinetic" resources to put victories in sight
 does not mean a ground forces-intensive response is required at
 If the President thinks it prudent to wait on our Arab partners, he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not-too-distant future

 For Attorney General Loretta Lynch is to create a federal response to months of unrest over controversial police killings. 
 Last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off riots in Baltimore

 As local departments aren't getting. 
 The Justice Department intends to crack down on police abuse using one of its most potent weapons: the power. 
 About in
 First re-establish order in Baltimore, the National Guard has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared
 "In the days ahead, I intend to work with leaders throughout Baltimore to ensure that we can protect the civil rights of residents," Lynch said on Monday
 I will bring the full resources of the Department of Justice to bear in protecting those under threat,.
 The Baltimore Police Department has been the subject
 According to a major investigation by The Baltimore Sun last fall, the city has paid out $5.7 million in court judgments or settlements to more than 100 people since 2011 in connection. 
ยยยยยย
 Residents were beaten; others were thrown to the pavement ". 
 Prosecutors or judges dismissed the charges.
 Kind of helped set the stage for the. 
Lynch has launched a probe of the death of Freddie Gray, and the Justice Department is also investigating the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, where an officer. 
 Attorney general has tools with which to law enforcement. 
 A Justice Department program called Community Oriented Policing Services, launched in 2011,. 
 Might come under question participating in the voluntary program
 Lynch can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments court-ordered reforms,.
 The provision was a result of the 1991 videotaped beating of Rodney King by Los. 
 The Obama administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the Clinton or Bush administrations -- and has opened 11 investigations of departments including those in Cleveland, Miami and Ferguson, Missouri
 Tough remedies may not be working, according to the Project,. 
 Local officials have found themselves grappling with problems they thought they had fixed "
 That leaves Lynch with a final, even tougher: the power, under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that. 
Lynch's predecessor as attorney general, Eric Holder, refrained from yanking funds, although in 2013 he did deny drug money to the sheriff's office in Alamance County, North Carolina, claiming the department was targeting Latinos for traffic stops
 The sheriff of Alamance County sued the Justice Department and the case remains unresolved but the fact that Lynch has the power to press local departments, legally and financially, to curb abuses
Should calm cities like Baltimore as the nation heads into what could be unrest
It's that international proportions

 (CNN) A New York jury deliberating the fate of the killing of Etan Patz is struggling to reach a verdict
 The little boy's disappearance, more than three decades ago, sparked awareness of crimes against children
 Communications resumed on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Maxwell ordered the jury to continue efforts to reach a decision on Hernandez
 The jurors on Wednesday said in a note that they were unable to reach. 
 Prosecutors said he made up the crime
://www.
 That he is mentally mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime or not
 Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Patz into a basement as the boy was on his way. 
He said he killed the boy and his body. 
 Neither the child nor his remains. 
Has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an "mental retardation range," his attorney Harvey Fishbein said
 Hernandez confessed
Anyone who sees confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz
 Doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the point of this case, said
 In November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights admissible in court
 Hernandez is charged with two counts of second-degree murder for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping
 Man's name has also hung over the Patz case Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester Etan's.

 The boy as part
 A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $. 
 Ramos was at the center, he has never been charged
He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting and was set to be released

 Adding to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify. 
 Public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies (1) in a "high crime" area "
 Police to the frisk.. 
 Police also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be "armed and dangerous" to conduct a search of the outer clothing for the purpose of weapons

 Officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his pants pocket

 Close call: Police were at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside...
 That was done

 According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a "," and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation
 The legality of the knife police have conceded that the knife was seen the stop
 The important thing is stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest
 The citizen should be free
 probable cause to believe a crime has been committed,
 knife was the only crime he was charged with, police are locked into narrative report
ingly, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the arrest
 The "knife" was one of those attached to a nail, that does not sound like probable cause for an arrest
 Based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife. 
 What would they have done with Gray?
 likely there was some that resulted in Gray
 As we've seen, charging officers with crimes is rare and difficult
 If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they force
 If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained their use
 Police's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported for processing, and that he may not have received medical attention
Not that
 From a strategic move for the police
 It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray his arrest
 "seizure" would be judged by a "reasonableness". 
 However, courts limited "seizures" to the act of seizing the person
 After the arrest are not by the Fourth Amendment
 The claims of an arrestee are governed by a clause of the 14th Amendment
 How
 Fourth Amendment anyway
 It makes a difference
 applicable and chances of winning a legal standard
 The test is whether the force was unreasonable based on the circumstances
 Amendment, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of suffering
 Tough burden for a plaintiff
Courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment,.
Confusing
 Alone
 Has taken issue with the Constitution
 jurisdictions have opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ. 
 It's just one of those jurisdictions

 British and American aid workers, Kurdish and Syrian soldiers and Egyptian Christians were among those who followed in Foley's wake: their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated online audience
 Highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group -- and a wave of recruits to the ISIS cause
, psychologist Arie W. Kruglanski suggest beheadings may be knocking-on
 The spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging threats of decapitation -- not only from Islamists, but from the "disbelievers" targets
://www.
 Of jihadist beheadings worldwide, "the concept of beheading, that was virtually non-existent in," he told CNN
 ", when you react aggressively,"
Situation when the passions run high and result in actual behavior
 Of beheadings also emerge from Saudi Arabia, where it is a method of execution under the country's judicial code and Brazil, where it is the work of criminal gangs
 Has placed the practice in the global spotlight to the same degree as ISIS, in which the threat "
 Similar with the phenomenon of mass shootings, said
 "Once the idea is planted then when someone is upset, feeling violent, the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes to mind, because it's in our unconscious," he said
 Lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are by.
 Such cases have been the headlines
 Four victims were decapitated outside a Florida home and in a shopping mall in China's Shaanxi province with no apparent connection to terror
 London, a city deeply affected by the attempted decapitation of soldier Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists in 2013, three women were reportedly beheaded last year.
 In the United States, an Oklahoma man is awaiting trial,. 
Whether he was inspired by ISIS propaganda remains unclear; he was reportedly a recent convert to Islam online
 "non-jihadist" beheadings are on the, this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness, as ISIS's beheadings have grabbed the terror group's call has reverberated worldwide
 In Australia and the Philippines, jihad-related have been made in the past seven months, a Muslim convert in London was found guilty of a plot to behead a British soldier, inspired by the murder
 The theme of beheading was also front and center in an incident in Belgium in January, where fans of football team the severed head
 ""
 Threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among, said
 In the U.S,.
 Months earlier, a threat to behead elementary school students
 professor of crime, security and justice at the Australian National University said the ISIS beheadings may have a sure way to get noticed
,"is clearly on show
 The threats demonstrated the way in which beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically "brutalizing" effect on society, said Kruglanski, intensifying the violence.
 "Ultimately, we're talking about contributing to the the planet," he said
 Justin Hastings, a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the University of Sydney, said that while ISIS beheadings ", he believed it would fall out
 ISIS as trade, it would lose its shock value, driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue. 
 An escalation occurred in February, when ISIS released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading Jordanian pilot. 
 ISIS released a video showing what appeared to be Kurdish Peshmerga. 
 For many, a baffling aspect has been overweening brutality. 
 Though the executions are viewed by the majority of people as repellent, said they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers "
ive with death and torture, which is sublimated culture
 Most peaceful drives exist in our subconscious; civilization rests on it
 "this drive to kill and promote violence" was legitimized by a powerful narrative, such as a call to global jihad, he said

Originally thought that a salt detected in Martian soil could pull water vapor from the planet's thin atmosphere into the cold
Researchers aren't saying they've seen direct evidence of brine in the night

 Cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally
 As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans.

 ISIS is clearly about religion -- radical Islam -- but it is also about power

 ISIS presents itself as a global organization,.
vernment primarily because of the rage of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their survival
 Sunni for some time
 The United States has tactical battles against ISIS and has pushed the group back from gains in Iraq

 ISIS find its foes lie within its Caliphate

 ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract,, the disenute
is repression
 No one voted ISIS into power anywhere
 simply to control
 Of course, one: Is ISIS a threat to the West

Their ambitions appear to be centered on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria

 They are a messaging machine, which in turn becomes. 
 What happens on the ground on the Internet
 ISIS is repulsive turn-off work on. 
 The shock and awe they produce is seen by tens

 As long as those young Muslim men, across the globe, are attracted to ISIS and stream to its cause, the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible.

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWSt
 Tough act
Hubble has returned spectacular images during the past but also helped discover that almost every galaxy has a black hole at its heart and the expansion of the universe is speeding up

 About the size JWST is as big as a tennis court
 There isn't a rocket currently capable of carrying that Chandler: "
 Named after Webb, a former NASA leader, JWST is being designed to study the stars and galaxies that formed in the early universe
NASA says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which Hubble can see
 The JWST will work in the spectrum, allowing scientists to detect targets
 The new telescope requires 25 square meters (about 270 square feet) and a golf ball of gold (1.7 ounces). 
 Is then coated with glass

 According to NASA, the mission is in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

 Scientists also believe the new telescope will detect stars
NASA says JWST should be able to operate for between five and 10 years, restricted only by the amount of fuel it has to maintain the electronics to stand up to the harsh space environment

 It's tough to say for sure, but here are some of the stark differences in the cases, lessons learned by both police and the public that could help mend tensions in the future
://www.
 Though it's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone, it's clear from the video that Scott was not posed a threat to Officer as he ran away
://www?
 It would be tough to extrapolate for certain, but it's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer, and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the violence that unfolded in months
 Ferguson residents outnumber whites in the suburb by more than a 2
 Two African-Americans were voted in city
 It's closer to an even split data showing the city is 47% black and 42% white
 The makeup of the police department is unclear, though it's been reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it. 
 Nine Council members are black
 The ratio of officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Police Department, but both are considerably off
 For the city councils, the latest election's. 
 Before you place too much emphasis on the percentages, there are other variables to consider as CNN political commentator Hill
Changing the racial makeup of a department won't do if officers aren't taught the best practices
 Didn't march and struggle to have black officers and black officers and black officers," he said
 I want police officers doing the job
 We need community-based policing if we're going to believe that police.
 There was no bystander video of Michael Brown's death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute. 
 It's unlikely Slager would have been charged with murder so quickly if not for video. 
 Police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scott's shooting

 That could be significant, because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser. 
 If investigators determine the Taser, could be accused

 After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful. 
 Ferguson residents say what happened in their city. 
 Smith made an unsuccessful bid for a Council seat, said he was glad to see South Carolina charge Slager with murder
 "I am hopeful that their motives are based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the issues that came down in Ferguson,"
 It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown, in the aftermath of the shooting, decided not to visit Brown
 Rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the the officer
 Charleston was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday,.

 Police wear cameras on their lapels
 Months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training police
 Slager also was not wearing when he killed Scott
 After the shooting, the mayor said the city was ordering an additional body cameras "so every officer on the street" in the city. 
 That's in addition to body cameras ordered, said
 Not everyone agrees body cameras
 Police unions have the American Civil Liberties Union. 
 They're expensive
 At least that can cost as much as 20
 National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect the public.

 Statement said Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter. 
 A felony charge that could land the deputy in prison for up to four years if found guilty
 An attorney said the shooting was an "excusable homicide."
 "We believe the video proves that it was an accident that occurred while Deputy was fulfilling his duties,"
 Not guilty of manslaughter
 Marks the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a chorus of criticism online
://www.
 They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company -- was on the scene in such a sting operation
 An attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid a cop in his spare time
 "It's absolutely mind boggling that you have a wealthy businessman who's been essentially deputized to play like he's," he said
 said his client -- who had donated cars and video equipment to the Sheriff's Office -- had undergone the required training with the task force. 
 The deputy in charge of arresting a suspect, Wood said, but was thrust into the situation because Harris during the arrest
 "probably in the past four of five years since he has been working in conjunction with the task force he has been,"
 He has never been on an arrest team or been the one responsible for the arrest of a suspect
 in a support mechanism
 Bates, who worked as a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training, according to the Sheriff's Office
 He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office,,
 Tulsa County Sheriff's Maj. Shannon Clark denied allegations that Bates had paid to play a cop, describing him as one of many who have contributed to the agency
 "No matter how you cut it up, met all the criteria on the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to be in the role he was in," Clark said
 After the shooting, told investigators that he was "in a state of shock" after realizing he'd fired his gun
 "strong possibility" that Harris had a gun
 said Monday that is upset over the shooting
 Obviously he is very upset

 He is TASER-certified and if you watch the video you know he.
Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his gun
 They've painted Harris as PCP-addled dealer who had sold methamphetamine to undercover police and who fled police that day in such a way as to give the impression that he had a gun in his waistband
 was later determined to be unarmed
 Tulsa Police Department, who has been brought in to review the case, excused the behavior of Bates in the video

 Specific crisis moment drought in its fourth year there has significance for the nation
 As it has in the past, California is leading the way in recognizing that population and economic growth has to respect planet
 System of legal rights it uses to distribute water at a time when the population was much smaller than it is today -- and when the climate was in an unusually wet. 
 This led to a system that encourages heavy water use in parts of the state, with little consistency in allocation or pricing and disincentive to waste
 This has made a lot of sense, but the new measures are the strongest acknowledgment yet that it isn't tenable today in drought
 The drought won't be the last, won't be the worst to. 
 may be temporary, hope that they'll be a step toward a more permanent reformation of the state's water distribution that includes large agricultural users, who are not included in the measures, although they are the dominant consumers of water

 From a, maybe
 Weather events make people aware that we are vulnerable to climate change. 
 Awareness can build the constituency for reducing greenhouse gases
 I lived in Australia for a year in 2007-08 when the country was well into a drought that lasted about a dozen years that led to restrictions in nearly all the country's major cities
 The role of greenhouse gases in that drought wasn't clear either, the hardship Americans were at the time
 The issue played a significant role in the national elections, with a climate-denialist (
 blaming climate change for a specific event shouldn't be the only thing to spur action on reducing greenhouse gases
 We're talking about a drought in California, a hurricane on the East Coast, a flood in the Midwest or a tornado outbreak on the Plains, the connection of climate change is likely to be the subject
 seriousness of global warming isn
 That human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate, and that these changes pose serious risks to humans and other species, doesn't rest on single-event attribution, but rather on the events
 What is what
 And when it comes to our getting better prepared for the degree of climate change that is inevitable, in many cases it matters to what extent a given event was human

 Extreme events are rare, most places haven't seen the worst nature can deliver,. 
 Tend to proceed under the assumption that worst won't happen, leaving us with infrastructures that aren't adapted to the current climate

Indiana's controversial religious freedom. 
 A,
 Pence said on Tuesday that the state will "fix" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,.
Right call
 Promoting religion versus protecting equality serves
 People hate the law hate the LGBT
 People of good can both be saved
 The way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one amendment, one that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental.
 It is a good thing for society to shape laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with. 
 Americans always have freedom and expression
 Few burdens on the religious practices
 In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- then religion should be granted an exemption
 Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves, it simply sends the message that religion is important and unless there are compelling reasons why people should be allowed to practice as they need
 These are the reasons why the RFRA was passed,.

 Society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked fine, before we realized its potential
 Kind of a shield for discrimination still take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell
 You have to be concerned with what the law allows. 
 Real
 Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to do so based on a belief
 Public perceptions
 It seems relevant to the public that this bill was passed with important decisions about marriage equality after the ruling in Baskin. 
 Appeals the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the answer for how to fix RFRA. 
Courts have held that a religious exemption cannot be granted is harmful
Not inherently evil
religious can be protected
 The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the.

 As it is, Miliband's ratings as leader improve
 Electoral strengths and weaknesses of the two leaders
 In an earlier clash before a audience and in a grilling by UK TV's Jeremy Paxman, Cameron proved vulnerable on broken promises to cut immigration, on the number of people employed on zero-hours contracts and on being too kind policies
 Miliband has looked unconvincing on how he will fund his promises to continue cutting the budget and how he will curb immigration; he also is embarrassed when he knifed to get the leader's job
